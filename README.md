# National Labor Relations Board (national-labor-relations-board)
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent federal agency responsible for protecting the rights of employees and employers in the United States. The NLRB administers the National Labor Relations Act, which guarantees the rights of employees to form unions and engage in collective bargaining with their employers. The NLRB investigates and resolves unfair labor practices, conducts elections to determine union representation, and enforces labor laws to promote fair and efficient labor relations. The NLRB plays a crucial role in ensuring that both employees and employers have a voice in the workplace and can work together to address workplace issues and improve working conditions.
