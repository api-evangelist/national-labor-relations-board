  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent federal agency
  responsible for protecting the rights of employees and employers in the United
  States. The NLRB administers the National Labor Relations Act, which
  guarantees the rights of employees to form unions and engage in collective
  bargaining with their employers. The NLRB investigates and resolves unfair
  labor practices, conducts elections to determine union representation, and
  enforces labor laws to promote fair and efficient labor relations. The NLRB
  plays a crucial role in ensuring that both employees and employers have a
  voice in the workplace and can work together to address workplace issues and
  improve working conditions.
